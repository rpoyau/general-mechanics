\begin{abstract}
This work presents a framework for mechanics derived from a single principle: the generalized Stokes identity on an informational manifold. By synthesizing this geometric bookkeeping with principles from thermodynamics and information theory, the framework demonstrates how core structures of physics can be reconstructed. The analysis yields the canonical rate equations of mechanics, the inverse–area scaling of boundary fields, and the propagation laws for wave‑like transport. The same structure yields operational limits such as time–information complementarity and finite channel capacity. For operational use, a constant‑free, one‑datum calibration maps the underlying informational field to measured sectors (e.g., gravitational, electric, thermal), rendering the framework predictive while keeping its core purely manifold‑theoretic.
