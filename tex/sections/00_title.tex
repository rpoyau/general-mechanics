\title{RIM+REOS: Relation Information Model + Relational Equation of State}
\author{Author One \and Author Two}
\date{\today}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present \emph{Relational Information Model} (RIM) and its dynamic extension via the \emph{Relational Equation of State} (REOS). The core axioms specify the model ontology (tracked relations on an oriented domain and an information state field). The dynamical axioms posit (i) a state-space flow generated by an Information Vector Field, (ii) a generalized Stokes ledger equating boundary flux with interior sources, and (iii) a state law relating information to tracked relations via conjugate potentials. Thermodynamic cost, uncertain informational force, a constrained action (with ledger + state constraints), a UV‑finite path integral regularized by multi‑clock bounds, a functional master equation, and ledger‑exact capacity bounds all follow. The resulting structure is scale‑free and applies on manifolds or chain complexes. We demonstrate the application to classical physics by \emph{choice}, not axiom: once a transport law is selected, mechanics and field forms are recovered directly from the ledger and REOS differential.
