\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}

We seek a compact, model-first mechanics where \emph{relations are primary}, state is \emph{informational}, and evolution is \emph{geometric}. Models are not laws; they are relational descriptions constrained by data compression and invariance. From this stance we derive a small set of modelling axioms (RIM) and a single geometric balance (generalized Stokes) that together generate kinematics and a thermodynamics-like \emph{relational equation of state} (REOS).

\paragraph{Three pillars.}
\begin{enumerate}\itemsep0.25em
  \item \textbf{Relationism.} All model content is constituted by internal distinctions and relations; no absolute background structures enter the model.
  \item \textbf{Information-theoretic modelling.} State is described by an information density $\rho$ (bits/nats up to a scale $C$); adequacy is compression under constraints (Shannon/MDL).
  \item \textbf{Geometric evolution.} Change is represented as balances across oriented boundaries (generalized Stokes), keeping derivations metric-free in the main thread.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Contributions.}
(i) Axiomatization of \emph{Relational Information Modelling} (RIM). (ii) A single \emph{Stokes balance} for informational currents. (iii) A differential \emph{REOS} $\mathrm d\rho=-\Lambda_a\,\mathrm dR^{(a)}$ with $\Lambda_a$ as prices. (iv) Compact derivations of force, action, and Maxwell-form identities as direct corollaries.
