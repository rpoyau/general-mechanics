\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

The motivation for this work is to construct a \emph{General Mechanics} from the ground up by synthesizing three of the most powerful and fundamental ideas from physics, engineering, and mathematics.

The approach is built on three core pillars:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Relationism.} A mechanical model is purely relational. Its properties and dynamics are determined by the network of connections within the model, not by any absolute background.

  \item \textbf{Information theory.} The substance of these relations is informational. Adopting an information‑theoretic modelling stance grounds the framework in operational limits from the outset: Shannon entropy and channel capacity \cite{Shannon1948,CoverThomas2006,Gallager1968}, and thermodynamic cost \cite{Landauer1961}.

  \item \textbf{Geometric calculus.} We describe the evolution of this relational, informational system using geometric calculus. Applying a generalized Stokes balance on an oriented $n{+}1$ domain to a well‑behaved informational phase vector field (IVF) lets the ``laws of motion'' emerge as a single, necessary consequence of the underlying geometry.
\end{enumerate}

This note therefore presents a set of axioms for this General Mechanics and begins the exploration of the rich, self‑consistent mathematical and conceptual framework that emerges from this modern synthesis.
