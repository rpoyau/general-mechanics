\section{Motivation\label{sec:motivation}}

Physics, social dynamics, communication networks—all update relations.  
The \emph{Relational Information Model} (RIM) keeps only relations and models
what is still unresolved.  Two ideas suffice: (i) relations are primary
(Mach); (ii) each unresolved binary choice measures one Shannon bit (Shannon,
1948).

\paragraph{Meta-Axiom M}
\emph{Only relational distinctions may be declared; an absolute property is
ill-formed and cannot enter the model.}
