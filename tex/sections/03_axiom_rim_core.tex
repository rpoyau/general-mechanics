\section{Relational Information Model (RIM): Core Axioms}
\label{sec:rim-core-axioms}

\subsection*{Notation (fixed for the axioms)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Base domain (space–time): oriented finite-dimensional manifold / chain complex $\mathcal M$; regions $V\subset\mathcal M$ with boundary $\partial V$.
  \item Tracked \emph{relations} $\{R_i\}$; their component densities form the \emph{relations vector} $R^{(a)}(x,t)$ (a.k.a.\ “resources” elsewhere in the note). % keep symbol R^{(a)} for backward compatibility
  \item Information state vector/field: $\vec\Psi(x,t)$ over $\mathcal M$.
  \item Shannon density $\rho$ is built from declared probabilities; log base sets units (bits/nats).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{RIM--C1 (Relationism).}
A model $M$ is constituted solely by a finite set of tracked relations $\{R_i\}$. Only statements invariant under automorphisms preserving $\{R_i\}$ are admissible.

\paragraph{RIM--C2 (Incompleteness).}
$M\ll T$: the model’s state space is a strict projection of the target’s state space.

\paragraph{RIM--C3 (Base domain).}
The model is posed on an oriented finite-dimensional domain $\mathcal M$ with induced boundary operator.

\paragraph{RIM--C4 (Information state field).}
At each $x\in\mathcal M$ the model has an \emph{Information State Vector} $\vec\Psi(x,t)$; the collection $\{\vec\Psi(x,t)\}_{x\in\mathcal M}$ is the \emph{Information State Field}.
