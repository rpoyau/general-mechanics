\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

\subsection{Aim and stance}
\label{introduction:aim-stance}
This work takes \emph{General Mechanics} to mean: familiar mechanics appear as \emph{relational motifs}
read from a single geometric identity (the generalized Stokes identity) on a chosen \emph{informational} manifold.
Relations are primary; observables are relational motifs. An observer specifies a region \(U\subset M\) with
boundary \(\partial U\); motifs are read from the boundary.


\subsection{Units and calibration}
Kz units \apref{app:kick} are used so energies and powers are rates. The abstract informational field is mapped
to measured sectors (gravitational, electric, thermal) by a \emph{one‑datum} linear calibration;
no bare constants are carried through the algebra.


\subsection{How to use the framework (recipe)}
\begin{enumerate}\itemsep2pt
  \item Declare \(U\subset M\) and \(\partial U\) (boundary or sector).
  \item Write the Stokes identity \(d(*j)=\sigma\,\mathrm{vol}\) and, when needed, the \emph{cut identity} on \(U\)
        \eqref{axioms:stokes:identity:eq:local-continuity}, \eqref{axioms:stokes:identity:eq:cut}.
  \item Choose a closure suited to the regime: \textbf{frame} \eqref{axioms:linear-closure:eq} for frame problems
        \nref{corollary:info-gas}, \nref{corollary:frame-boundary}; or a \textbf{wave‑supporting} closure for export on
        source‑free segments \seref{waves}. If the window is LTI and causal, the Causality–Dispersion comparison may be
        used locally \seref{waves:causality-dispersion}.
  \item Count distinctions on \(\partial U\) in a ternary alphabet (\emph{yes/no/unknown}) using information‑theoretic
        bookkeeping, and relate them to \(j\).
  \item If comparison with a measured sector is required, fix a single datum to calibrate \apref{app:kick}.
  \item Read \textbf{frame laws} from the inverse‑area rule (\(\propto 1/A\); \nref{corollary:info-gas}, \nref{corollary:frame-boundary};
        for wave export and far‑field envelopes \seref{waves}.
  \item Apply operational limits: time–information complementarity \nref{corollary:time-info} and the counting‑noise floor
        \nref{corollary:noise} for finite windows/areas.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Scope and reductions}
Dimensional reductions (1D/2D confinement) are handled by replacing \(A_n(r)\) with an effective
cross‑section/circumference; the resulting \textbf{frame} and wave summaries appear in \seref{corollary:dimensional}.
Detailed wave envelopes and exported‑power statements are collected in \seref{waves}.
